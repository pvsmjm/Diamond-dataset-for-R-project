# Diamond-dataset-for-R-project
The diamonds dataset is a dataset that comes built-in with the ggplot2 package in R.

It contains measurements on 10 different variables (like price, color, clarity, etc.) for 53,940 different diamonds.

This tutorial explains how to explore, summarize, and visualize the diamonds dataset in R.
Load the diamonds Dataset
Since the diamonds dataset is a built-in dataset in ggplot2, we must first install (if we havenâ€™t already) and load the ggplot2 package:

#install ggplot2 if not already installed
install.packages('ggplot2')

#load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
